            <h1>DYSTOPIAN</h1>
            <p class="tagline">The year is 2050… and the world has fallen silent.
                In the ashes of failed governments and broken systems, a new force has appeared the Dominion.
                
                They promised a new order. They promised peace. And we believed them.
                
                But their peace came with a price… control.
                The Dominion controls everything. 
                
                They built the Humannet: a network that links every human to their system. Through it, they watch. Through it, they listen. And through it, they command.
                
                Your thoughts… are not your own. Your emotions… are not your own. They decide what you feel, what you think, what you become.
                
                
                Most people don’t even realize they’re slaves. They wake, they work, they sleep, all while the Dominion pulls the strings from the shadows.
                
                But there are a few—those who remember what it means to be free. They fight, in secret, against an enemy that knows their every move.
                 
                They are the rebels, a small band of outcasts who refuse to let their minds be shackled.
                
                In dark corners, they gather, sharing whispers of a past where choice was alive. But every act of defiance is met with brutal punishment, as the Dominion’s enforcers relentlessly hunt them down
                
                Because in a world where the Dominion controls the mind, rebellion is a crime punishable by erasure. Step out of line, and they don’t just take your life… they take you</p>
